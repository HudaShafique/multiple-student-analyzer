# Multi-Student Marks Analyzer
This Python project allows you to record marks for multiple students, calculate total, average, highest, and lowest marks, and display grades for each student.  
<br>
It demonstrates Python basics like loops, lists, dictionaries, and basic data analysis, which are important foundations for data handling in ML projects.

## Features
- Takes name and roll number for multiple students
- Accepts marks for 5 subjects for each student
- Calculates total, average, highest, and lowest marks
- Assigns grade and remark based on average
- Displays a clean, structured report for each student

## Example Output
<br>
Name: Ali
<br>
Roll No: 1
<br>
Marks: [12, 23, 34, 45, 56]
<br>
Total: 170
<br>
Average: 34.0
<br>
Highest: 56
<br>
Lowest: 12

## Skills Used
- Python basics: loops, input, variables
- Lists and dictionaries for data storage
- Arithmetic operations: sum, max, min
- Conditional logic for grading
- Structured output formatting

## Future Improvements
- Allow variable number of subjects for each student
- Input validation to prevent invalid marks
- Save reports to a CSV file for further analysis
- Add GUI for easier interaction
